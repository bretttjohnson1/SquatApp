    <string name="help_text">To Use:\n
        Open the Start menu in the app drawer then press start. A countdown will start. During this countdown (Before the vibration), put the phone in your pocket.
        (Should you not put the phone in pocket fast enough, restart the set).\n\n
        IMPORTANT: Make sure that the phone is flat on your leg for best results.\n\n
        Begin the set of squats after the phone in your pocket vibrates to signal it is ready. The phone will also vibrate upon you hitting parallel.\n\n
        When done, take the phone out of your pocket and press the now red button to stop the set.\n\n
        IMPORTANT: The app relies on gyroscope to detect squats. It is okay to turn the phone upside-down ONCE after taking it out of your pocket (Twice will register a new fake squat).\n\n
        After you have stopped the sets, you now have access to the data. Any of the squats in the new list to view individual squat data. You may scroll through the grid at the bottom
        to view analysed stats about your squat.\n\n
        To view stats regarding all of the squats, go to the stats menu in the left drawer. It works much like the individual stats.
